# JAX CNN

A CNN implementation using JAX for training neural networks on image classification tasks.

## Overview

This project contains implementations of neural networks using the JAX library:

- **CNN Implementation** (`cnn_jax.py`): Convolutional Neural Network for image classification
- **RNN Implementation** (`rnn_jax.py`): Recurrent Neural Network implementation

## Current Status

The project is in active development with basic CNN functionality implemented. Current results show room for improvement, with fine-tuning planned for future iterations.

## Files

- `cnn_jax.py` - Main CNN implementation
- `rnn_jax.py` - RNN implementation 
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore configuration

## Requirements

- JAX
- Python 3.x

## Usage

Run the CNN training:
```bash
python cnn_jax.py
```

Run the RNN training:
```bash
python rnn_jax.py
```

## Notes

This is an experimental project focused on learning JAX implementations of neural networks. Performance optimization and fine-tuning are ongoing.
